## Installation

You can install the development version of blockr.session from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.session")
```

## Example

We can start up an app that uses the `manage_session()` plugin by swapping out the default `preserve_board()` plugin.

```r
library(blockr.core)
library(blockr.session)
serve(new_board(), plugins = c(board_plugins(-1), manage_session()))
```

The default storage backend is [pins::board_local()] which can be configured by setting the `session_mgmt_backend` [blockr_option()].
